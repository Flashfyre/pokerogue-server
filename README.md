# rogueserver

# Hosting in Docker
It is advised that you host this in a docker container as it will be much easier to manage. 
There is a sample docker-compose file for setting up a docker container to setup this server.

# Self Hosting outside of Docker:
## Windows:
Recommended Tools:
Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install)

## Required Tools:
- Golang
- Node: **18.3.0**
- npm: [how to install](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Installation:

Once you have all the prerequisites you will need to setup a database. 
There are tons of database services you can choose from:
- mysql - [getting started](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/)
- mariadb - [getting started](https://mariadb.com/get-started-with-mariadb/)
- etc

I went with MySQL. Once the database is setup, make sure that you can authenticate to the database.
After being able to login to the database, create a database/schema called pokeroguedb.
Select it as the default database and then run the sql queries from sqlqueries.sql. You should now be able to see all of the empty tables. 

Edit the following files:
### rogueserver.go:34 
Change the 'false' after "debug" to 'true'. This will resolve CORS issues that many users have been having while trying to spin up their own servers. 

### rogueserver.go:37
Change the default port if you need to, I set it to 8001.

### rogueserver.go:39-43
Make sure that the credentials that you tested to login to the database are put in here. 

### src/utils.ts:224-225 (in pokerogue)
Replace both URLs (one on each line) with the local API server address from rogueserver.go (0.0.0.0:8001) (or whatever port you picked)

# If you are on Windows

Now that all of the files are configured: start up powershell as administrator:
```
powershell -ep bypass
cd C:\api\server\location\
go run .
```

Then in another run this the first time then run `npm run start` from the rogueserver location from then on:
```
powershell -ep bypass
cd C:\rogue\server\location\
npm install
npm run start
```
You will need to allow the port youre running the API (8001) on and port 8000 to accept inbound connections through the [Windows Advanced Firewall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9llH5_CON-Y).

# If you are on Linux
In whatever shell you prefer, run the following:
```
cd C:\api\server\location\
go run . &
cd C:\rogue\server\location\
npm run start
```

You will need to allow the ports youre running the API (8001) and port 8000 to accept inbound connections if your firewall is block it. you can run the following to allow incoming connections using UFW
```
sudo ufw allow 8000,8001/tcp
```

This should allow you to reach the game from other computers on the same network. 

## Tying to a Domain

If you want to tie it to a domain like I did and make it publicly accessible, there is some extra work to be done.

I setup caddy and would recommend using it as a reverse proxy. 
[caddy installation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
once its installed setup a config file for caddy:

```
pokerogue.exampledomain.com {
	reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
pokeapi.exampledomain.com {
	reverse_proxy localhost:8001
} 
```
Preferably set up caddy as a service from [here.](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running)

Once this is good to go, take your API url (https://pokeapi.exampledomain.com) and paste it on 
### src/utils.ts:224-225 
in place of the previous 0.0.0.0:8001 address

Make sure that both 8000 and 8001 are portforwarded on your router.

Test that the server's game and game authentication works from other machines both in and outside of the network. Once this is complete, enjoy!
